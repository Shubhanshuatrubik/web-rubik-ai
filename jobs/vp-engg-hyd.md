### About Rubik
We began Rubik because we have a passion for solving data-oriented problems. However, we also understand that data is people-centric.

Help transform our client enterprises by providing widespread access to the data needed throughout their entire organization where stakeholders can quickly and easily extract actionable insights.
Construct a people-centric team that possesses a combination of both hard and soft skills along with our core principles: humbleness, transparency, accountability, and empathy.  

### What We Offer
Rubik offers a highly competitive compensation and benefits package including medical, health and fitness incentives, generous PTO and holidays, and a casual fun work environment. At Rubik, we don't just accept difference - we celebrate it, we support it, and we count on it to benefit of our team, our products, and our community.
 
Rubik is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.
